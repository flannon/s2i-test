# Creating a basic S2I builder image  

This is a basic test configuration to demonstrate s2i in minishift.  It deploys a simple hearbeat applicaiton to keep the contianer alive.

#### Dockerfile
Create a *Dockerfile* that installs all of the necessary tools and libraries that are needed to build and run our application.  This file will also handle copying the s2i scripts into the created image.

#### S2I scripts

##### assemble
Create an *assemble* script that will build our application, e.g.:
- build python modules
- bundle install ruby gems
- setup application specific configuration

The script can also specify a way to restore any saved artifacts from the previous image.   

##### run
Create a *run* script that will start the application. 

##### save-artifacts (optional)
Create a *save-artifacts* script which allows a new build to reuse content from a previous version of the application image.

##### usage (optional) 
Create a *usage* script that will print out instructions on how to use the image.

##### Make the scripts executable 
Make sure that all of the scripts are executable by running *chmod +x s2i/bin/**

#### Create the builder image

You can test building the image in the docker registry, 

    docker build testimage .

or make the builder image directly from the git repo with oc,

    oc new-build flannon/s2i-test

Once the image has finished building, the command, 

    s2i usage <image-name:latest>

To get the full image name you can query the docker registry,

    docker images | grep s2i-test

In my case I did this to run the usage script,

    s2i usage 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/s2i-test:latest


#### Testing the builder image
You can test the image from the  docker build like this:
```
docker build -t testimage-candidate .
IMAGE_NAME=testImage-candidate test/run
```

Or just run the Makefile and and it'll test the image,

    make test


#### Creating the application image
The application image combines the builder image with your applications source code, which is served using whatever application is installed via the *Dockerfile*, compiled using the *assemble* script, and run using the *run* script.
The following command will create the application image:
```
s2i build test/test-app testImage testImage-app
---> Building and installing application from source...
```
Using the logic defined in the *assemble* script, s2i will now create an application image using the builder image as a base and including the source code from the test/test-app directory. 

#### Running the application image
Running the application image is as simple as invoking the docker run command:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 testImage-app
```
The application, which consists of a simple static web page, should now be accessible at  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Using the saved artifacts script
Rebuilding the application using the saved artifacts can be accomplished using the following command:
```
s2i build --incremental=true test/test-app nginx-centos7 nginx-app
---> Restoring build artifacts...
---> Building and installing application from source...
```
This will run the *save-artifacts* script which includes the custom code to backup the currently running application source, rebuild the application image, and then re-deploy the previously saved source using the *assemble* script.
